# ip-osint-abuseipdb
A minimal IP OSINT tool powered by Abuse IP DB

A PHP web app integrated with Abuse IP DB to fetch deatils about an IP address provided by reports from many users and webmasters.

No plugins have been used and can be directly integrated on any php website. All you need is the API key from [Abuse IP DB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)

Please note that this script is not a part of the Abuse IP DB documentation. This script communicates with the one of API endpoints and fetches the details.
Feel free to use the script and contribute to make it better.
We'll be happy to see pull requests from you!
